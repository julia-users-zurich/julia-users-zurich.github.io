We meet regularly to discuss coding in Julia or just hang out.

There is a
[Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zurich-Julia-User-Group/)
where you can register, although you can come otherwise too (drop us
an email).  This is also where details about the meetups, such as location will be posted.

This page is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/julia-users-zurich/julia-users-zurich.github.io); feel free to file issues or open pull-requests.

Organisers: [Mauro Werder](https://github.com/mauro3/)
